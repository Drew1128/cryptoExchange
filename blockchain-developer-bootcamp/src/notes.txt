Migrations 
- It is important that you number your migration files, because truffle needs to know what order to run them in 
- Migrations basically means that you are changing the blockchains state 
- The Token.json file create an javascript abstraction of the smart contract and it can read them from the global 
artifacts variable (located in the migrations directory) and require the Token out of that.    Example: artifacts.reguire("Token")
